# Travel Club 
A travel app that helps the user research various travel clubs (read: time shares rebranded) around the world.  The user is able to search our database or view featured thumbnails.  Once a destination is selected the user can see how far the hotel is from the airport, the address, phone number and website.  The user can click through the tabs and read the resort's description, the unique amenities at that resort, the current weather, a google map, and various tours in the surrounding area.  As an administrator of the website you have the ability to log in and add properties to the database.

This is the second iteration of this repo: https://github.com/katieburrows/Travel.  This iteration includes a more polished frontend and added apis.
